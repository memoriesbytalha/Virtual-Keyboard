# Virtual Keyboard using Hand Gestures

This project implements a virtual keyboard controlled by hand gestures using OpenCV, the `cvzone` library for hand detection, and `pynput` for simulating keyboard actions. The user can type text by performing specific hand gestures to interact with an on-screen keyboard.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Detection**: The system uses a hand tracker to detect and track hand movements and gestures.
- **Virtual Keyboard**: A dynamic virtual keyboard is displayed on the screen. The keys are activated when the user’s hand gestures (such as finger positions) align with the respective keys.
- **Typing Simulation**: When a key is pressed by the user’s finger hovering over it, the corresponding character is typed using the `pynput` keyboard controller.
- **Shift Key**: The system includes a shift functionality, allowing uppercase characters to be typed.
- **Clear Text**: The system supports a backspace functionality to remove the last typed character.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- `opencv-python`
- `cvzone`
- `pynput`
- `math`
- `time`

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone pynput
```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Script**: Start the Python script `virtual_keyboard.py` to initialize the webcam and the virtual keyboard interface.
2. **Hand Tracking**: The script uses the webcam to detect your hand and track finger positions.
3. **Interact with the Keyboard**: Hover your hand over the on-screen keyboard keys. When your index finger is near a key, it will be highlighted.
4. **Press a Key**: When your finger is sufficiently close to a key (based on a distance threshold), the key will be "pressed," and the corresponding character will be typed.
5. **Special Keys**: 
   - `Up`: Toggles between lowercase and uppercase mode.
   - `Cl`: Clears the last typed character (backspace).
   - `Sc`: Adds a space character.

To quit the program, press the 'q' key.

## Code Breakdown

- **Hand Detection**: The program uses `cvzone`'s `HandDetector` to detect and track the hand's key landmarks.
- **Keyboard Layout**: The virtual keyboard is made up of two layouts: one for lowercase letters and another for uppercase letters. This can be toggled using the `Up` button.
- **Interaction**: The `pynput.keyboard.Controller()` is used to simulate key presses when a finger is hovering over a key.
- **User Interface**: The on-screen virtual keyboard is displayed with OpenCV, where each key is a clickable button drawn on the image frame.

## File Structure

```

  |-- README.md            # This README file
```

## Future Improvements

- Add more advanced gesture recognition (e.g., swiping gestures to switch between different modes).
- Implement better error handling for hand detection and key press simulation.
- Add support for more complex keyboard layouts (e.g., numbers, symbols).
- Improve responsiveness and performance of the keyboard.
